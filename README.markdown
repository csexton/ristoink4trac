Vibrant Ink like code color scheme for Trac
===========================================

[On trac-hacks](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/VibrantInkCodeTheme)

Not a full theme, just a little hack of the code.css to provide a dark background to the code with a color scheme similar to the excellent [VibrantInk](http://alternateidea.com/blog/articles/2006/1/3/textmate-vibrant-ink-theme-and-prototype-bundle) colors sheme for [TextMate](http://textmate.org/).

This will give the code in Browse Source as well as in monospace blocks with code processors. (i.e. #!python)

Many thanks to Justin Palmer and his VibrantInk color scheme.
